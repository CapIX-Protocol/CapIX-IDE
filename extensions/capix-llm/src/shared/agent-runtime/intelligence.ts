/**
 * @capix/agent-runtime — intelligence event contracts.
 *
 * Stable contracts for intelligence-driven events that both Capix Code TUI
 * and CapixIDE must handle. These are TYPE CONTRACTS ONLY — the actual
 * implementations live in the TUI and IDE clients that consume
 * @capix/agent-runtime.
 *
 * The intelligence layer (plans, agents, memory, checkpoints, receipts)
 * emits events when durable state changes. Clients subscribe via the
 * `IntelligenceEvents` registration methods so they can:
 *  - refresh plan-aware UI when a new plan is persisted;
 *  - update the agents panel when a specialist is spawned;
 *  - surface a "memory written" indicator when a decision/constraint lands;
 *  - mark a checkpoint as safe-to-resume-from when one is created;
 *  - refresh the receipts / billing view when a work receipt is anchored.
 *
 * Refs:
 *  - architecture §12.3 (broker), §12.4 (provider/routing)
 *  - intelligence commands (commands/*.md) — each command persists state via
 *    `src/intelligence-client.ts` and the server emits the matching event.
 *
 * This package intentionally does NOT import the host's
 * `src/intelligence-client.ts` — the runtime contracts are self-contained so
 * both clients can depend on @capix/agent-runtime alone. The richer API
 * client types live in `src/intelligence-client.ts` and are structurally
 * compatible with the payloads emitted here (the field names line up).

/**

 * intelligence event and returns an `Unsubscribe` function. Implementations
 * are responsible for wiring the underlying transport (SSE, websocket, or
 * polling) — this interface only defines the registration contract.
 *
 * Implementations MUST:
 *  - support multiple registrations per event type (fan-out);
 *  - call callbacks in registration order;
 *  - never block the transport on a slow callback — dispatch asynchronously;
 *  - guarantee `Unsubscribe` is idempotent (safe to call after the
 *    subscription was already removed);
 *  - tolerate a callback that throws (log + continue, do not break the fan-out).
